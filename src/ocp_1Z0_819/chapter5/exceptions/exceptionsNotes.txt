Exceptions  |
____________|

    It is possible to handle exceptions using try-catch block

    Exceptions have two types:

        1) One that inherit from RuntimeException --> Unchecked Exceptions
        2) One that inherit from Exception only --> Checked Exceptions



============================
Try-with-resources
============================

    1) When opening a file, then after working with it, it has to be closed

            (!) Try-with-resources statements automatically close all opened instances upon try-block finish

    2) Try-with-resources means, that you will create instances inside the: try(*here*)
        - multiple instances are separated by semi-colon ;

            (!) try‐with‐resources statements require resources that implement the AutoCloseable interface

            (!) try-with-resources does NOT require a catch block

    3) AutoCloseable interface has one abstract method - `public void close() throws Exception;` to override
       - Closeable interface inherits AutoCloseable but close() method throws IOException


    -------------------
    Writing resources
    -------------------

        (!) Resources can be written before the try block, but they must be final or effectively final.
            - it is bad idea though
