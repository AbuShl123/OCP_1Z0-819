Assertions  |
____________|

========================
Introduction
========================

    Definition:
    --> Assertions are booleans expressions, that programmer puts at some point of the code, where it expects something to be true
    Assertions may contain an optional message and may be disabled or enabled

    PURPOSE:
        assertions are used for debugging purposes. They are usually turned off for production environment

    (!) If assertion fails, the AssertionError is thrown. It's an error meaning it is fatal


    ||        Assertions vs Unit Tests:
    ||            Many developers use various unit testing frameworks, such as JUnit.
    ||
    ||            1) While there are some similarities, assertions are used to verify internal state of a program
    ||               while Unit Tests are most frequently used to verify a behaviour.
    ||            2) Unit tests are equipped with lots of features and possibilities, so it is better to use unit tests in professional experience


    Assertion outcomes:
        1) If assertions are disabled, Java skips the assertion and goes on in the code
        2) If assertions are enabled and the boolean expression is true, then our assertion has been validated
           and nothing happens. The program continues to execute in its normal manner.
        3) If assertions are enabled and the boolean expression is false, then our assertion is invalid and an
           AssertionError is thrown.

    Assertion rules:
        Assertions should never alter the outcomes

        ` int a = 10;
          assert ++a == 11; // BAD CODING `

====================================
Enabling and Disabling assertions
====================================

    (!) By default assertions are disabled

    - To enable assertions use -ea or -enableassertions flag:
      To disable use -da or -disableassertions flag

            java -ea Rectangle.java


    - It is also possible to enable assertions only for specific directories:
      Ellipsis (...) means any class inside 'demos' package or subpackages.

            java -ea:com.demos... my.programs.Main

            java -ea:com.demos.TestColors my.programs.Main


    - You can disable assertions for some classes while enabling for others:

        java -ea:com.demos... -da:com.demos.TestColors my.programs.Main
