Optional
________________________

    You use optional, when you want to express the absence of any value

        Example:
                - You are attending a class
                - You teachers ask you to tell them your average grade
                - But you didn't take any exams yet, because the classes only started
                - 0 will be a wrong answer, because you simply have no average grade
                ------> Use Optional.empty() instead


        Before, developers would use a 'null' instead of Optional, but that had some shortcomings

        (!) Returning Optional is a clear statement in the API that there might not be a value in there
